# RecipeDictator (under construction)

A better version of Recipio, using Meteorjs, Reactjs, CMUSphinx, the Web Speech API, and Wit.ai.

Lots of work to do still.

Recipe Dictator is a web app that will read steps from a recipe to you while you cook. You can speak to the app and ask questions or ask for the next step and it will respond.
